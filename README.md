## Conversion of CVSS v3 to CVSS v2

When converting Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vectors from version 3 (v3) to version 2 (v2), it is essential to acknowledge the inherent data and precision loss that arises due to the asymmetrical nature of the vector mappings between these two versions.

The CVSS v3 specification introduces additional metrics and finer granularity in scoring, which are not present in CVSS v2. Consequently, some information captured in a CVSS v3 vector cannot be precisely translated into a CVSS v2 vector. For instance, the v3 metrics such as Scope (S) and Privileges Required (PR) have no direct equivalents in CVSS v2, leading to unavoidable data loss. Additionally, the reduction in complexity levels and the different handling of user interaction and authentication further contribute to a loss of precision. This conversion, while providing a useful approximation, should be undertaken with an understanding of these limitations, ensuring that the results are interpreted within the context of the reduced granularity and altered metric mappings.

To account for these discrepancies, the following conversion conversion logic is proposed:

1. Attack Vector (AV): Physical (P) in v3 is mapped to Local (L) in v2.
2. Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) and High (H) are mapped directly to Low (L) and High (H) in v2. The Medium complexity in v2 is not used in this conversion.
3. Privileges Required (PR): Low (L) in v3 maps to Single (S) Authentication in v2. High (H) in v3 maps to Multiple (M) Authentication in v2. None (N) in v3 maps to None (N) Authentication in v2.
4. User Interaction (UI): Required (R) in v3, if the previously converted Attack Complexity (AC) was Low (L), changes AC to Medium (M) in v2.
5. Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (C, I, A): Low (L) in v3 maps to Partial (P) in v2. High (H) in v3 maps to Complete (C) in v2.
6. Scope (S): Changed (C) in v3 does not have a direct equivalent in v2, and this represents an information loss.

This logic ensures that we can convert a CVSS v3 vector to a CVSS v2 vector while accounting for edge cases and providing a clear mapping for each metric.

Example conversion table based on the above logic:
